    Import the file restaurant.json to local MongoDB and prepare REST API.
    The API should support the following methods:
    GET /getAll - get all records
    GET /getByCity - get all restaurants by city
    GET /getByName - get all restaurants by name
    GET /getByRating - get all restaurants by rating
    GET /getByType - get all restaurants by type of food
    GET /countCity - get number of restaurants in each city
    POST /addRestaurant - add restaurant
    POST /deleteRestaurant - remove restaurant
    
    <!--use debug to see what querries are run by mongoose-->
    POST /editRestaurant - modify restaurant
    
    GET /getBestRestaurantsByCity - get 5 best resturants by city
    GET /getBestRestaurantsByCityAndType - get 5 best resturants by city and type of food
    GET /getAvgRatingByCity - get average restaurants rating by city

    - Add indexes.
    - Use debug.
    - Measure 'find' time.
    - Use promises or async/await where necessary.
    - Use mongoose to connect to local MongoDB.
    - Use body-parser to read POST body params.

    Please create repository on GitHub called ukRestaurants and commit often!
